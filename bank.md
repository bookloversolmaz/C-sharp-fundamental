# Bank Challenge

This exercise brings together most, if not all, of the things you've learned so far. You might find that it reveals some gaps in your knowledge - that's a useful outcome! Make a note of those and think about how you can address them. If you're not sure, ask your coach.

## Specification

You're going to test-drive a Console Application that can track banking transactions, like deposits and withdrawals, and print a statement.

### Requirements

* You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2023  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2023  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2023  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
